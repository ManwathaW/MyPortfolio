# ?? WHY YOU CAN'T FIND YOUR PORTFOLIO ON GOOGLE - SOLVED!

## ? The Problem

You can't find your portfolio when searching "manwatha wanga" on Google because:

1. **Site is not deployed live** ? This is the main issue!
   - Currently only accessible on your computer (localhost)
   - Google can't crawl private/local sites
   - Must be on the internet (live URL)

2. **Google hasn't indexed it yet**
   - New sites take 2-4 weeks to appear in Google
   - Requires submission to Search Console
   - Requires proper SEO setup

3. **Missing critical SEO files**
   - No sitemap.xml to tell Google what pages exist
   - No robots.txt to guide crawlers
   - Google doesn't know what to index
